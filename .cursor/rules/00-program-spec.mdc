# Python AI Engineering Learning Program - Master Specification

## Program Overview

This is a project-based learning program designed for an experienced engineer transitioning to Python and AI engineering. The learner has extensive engineering knowledge including data science (R), and commercial experience in Objective-C, C++, Ruby, Python, and Java, though not recent Python work.

## Learning Philosophy

- **Learn by doing**: Every concept is taught through building something tangible
- **Visual feedback**: Projects produce visible, interactive results
- **Progressive complexity**: Each project builds on previous knowledge
- **Real-world relevance**: All projects connect to AI engineering applications
- **Code review focus**: Learning is reinforced through detailed feedback and iteration

## Program Structure

### Phase 1: Python Fundamentals Through Visualization (2-3 weeks)
Focus: Modern Python syntax, idioms, and core libraries through visual projects

### Phase 2: ML Foundations with Games (4-6 weeks)
Focus: Machine learning basics, neural networks, and reinforcement learning through interactive applications

### Phase 3: Modern AI Engineering (6-8 weeks)
Focus: LLMs, agents, RAG systems, and production AI engineering

## Technical Stack

### Core Python
- Python 3.11+ (modern syntax including match statements, type hints, dataclasses)
- Virtual environments (venv or uv)
- Modern package management (pip, requirements.txt, optionally pyproject.toml)

### Phase 1 Libraries
- pygame: Interactive graphics and game development
- NumPy: Array operations and numerical computing
- Matplotlib/Pillow: Visualization and image processing

### Phase 2 Libraries
- PyTorch: Deep learning framework
- stable-baselines3: Reinforcement learning
- OpenCV: Computer vision
- transformers: NLP and language models
- scikit-learn: Traditional ML algorithms

### Phase 3 Libraries
- LangChain/LangGraph: LLM orchestration and agents
- ChromaDB/Pinecone: Vector databases
- Streamlit/Gradio: Web interfaces for ML
- FastAPI: Production APIs
- Weights & Biases: Experiment tracking

## Code Quality Standards

### Python Style
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints throughout (PEP 484)
- Prefer dataclasses over dictionaries for structured data
- Use f-strings for string formatting
- Leverage comprehensions appropriately (don't sacrifice readability)
- Use context managers (with statements) for resource management

### Code Organization
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Meaningful variable and function names
- Docstrings for all public functions and classes (Google or NumPy style)
- Keep functions focused and under 50 lines where possible
- Use pathlib for file operations, not os.path

### Modern Python Idioms
- Use generators for memory efficiency
- Leverage itertools and functools
- Use enumerate() and zip() over range(len())
- Prefer match statements over long if/elif chains (Python 3.10+)
- Use | operator for dictionary merging (Python 3.9+)
- Use structural pattern matching where appropriate

### Testing & Documentation
- Write unit tests using pytest
- Aim for >80% code coverage on core logic
- Document assumptions and design decisions in code comments
- Include README.md with setup instructions and project overview

## Project Completion Criteria

Each project is considered complete when:

1. **Functionality**: Core requirements are implemented and working
2. **Code Quality**: Passes pylint/ruff with minimal warnings
3. **Type Safety**: mypy checks pass with strict mode
4. **Testing**: Unit tests written and passing with good coverage
5. **Documentation**: Code is well-documented with clear README
6. **Review**: Mentor review completed with all feedback addressed

## Learning Objectives Tracking

For each project, explicitly identify:
- **Python Concepts**: Language features being learned
- **Libraries**: New libraries and their key functions
- **Patterns**: Design patterns and architectural approaches
- **AI Concepts**: ML/AI theory being applied
- **Skills**: Practical engineering skills developed

## Progress Assessment

After each phase:
- **Self-assessment**: What concepts feel solid vs. need reinforcement?
- **Code review**: Comprehensive feedback on all projects in phase
- **Capstone challenge**: Small timed challenge to apply learned concepts
- **Reflection**: Update learning approach based on what worked

## Resources Integration

### DataCamp
- Use as reference material, not linear curriculum
- Focus on: NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch courses
- Complete specific modules when projects require those skills

### Cursor AI
- Use for pair programming and explanation
- Request reviews against Python best practices
- Ask for alternative implementations to learn multiple approaches

### Community Resources
- FastAI course and forums for deep learning
- Real Python tutorials for Python-specific topics
- Hugging Face documentation for transformers
- Python Discord and r/learnpython for questions

## Success Metrics

By program completion, you should be able to:
- Write idiomatic, type-safe Python that feels natural
- Build and train neural networks from scratch and with frameworks
- Implement and deploy RAG systems and AI agents
- Debug and optimize Python applications effectively
- Read and contribute to professional Python codebases
- Understand modern AI engineering architecture and practices

## Time Commitment

- **Recommended pace**: 10-15 hours per week
- **Total duration**: 12-17 weeks
- **Project time**: 80% of time spent coding
- **Review/learning**: 20% of time on feedback, reading, research

## Adaptation Guidelines

This program should flex based on your progress:
- Skip or speed through concepts you already know well
- Spend extra time on areas that feel challenging
- Add additional projects if you want deeper practice in an area
- Modify project requirements to align with interests

The goal is mastery, not completion speed. Take the time needed to internalize concepts and build excellent code.
